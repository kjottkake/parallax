       <h1>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development</h1>
       <p>More than 3 billion people rely on the oceans for their livelihoods, and more than 80 per cent of world merchandise
    trade by volume is carried by sea. The oceans, seas and marine resources are under constant threat from pollution,
    warming and acidification that are disrupting marine ecosystems and the communities they support. These changes have
    long-term repercussions that require the world to urgently scale up the protection of marine environments, investment in
    ocean science, support for small-scale fishery communities, and the sustainable management of the oceans.</p>
